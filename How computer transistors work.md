# How computer transistors work?


A transistor is a tiny electronic device that is used in computers to control the flow of electrical signals.

It has three parts: the base, the emitter, and the collector. When a small voltage is applied to the base, it allows a larger current to flow from the collector to the emitter.

In a computer, transistors are used to create logic gates, which are the basic building blocks of digital circuits. These circuits take one or more inputs and produce an output based on those inputs.

Transistors can be combined to create more complex circuits, which are used in arithmetic and memory operations in computers.
