# Web Tech

Web technology refers to the tools, techniques, and software used for creating websites and web applications. This includes programming languages, databases, web servers, and client-side scripts that make web pages interactive.

Popular web technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python.

Frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, Laravel, Django, and Flask offer pre-built components and tools to speed up development rather than creating basic components from scratch.
