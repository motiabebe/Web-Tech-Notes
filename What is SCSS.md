# What is SCSS

# 

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a language similar to CSS that makes it easier to write and maintain CSS code. It has features like variables, nesting, and mixins that make it more flexible and efficient. SCSS is compiled into CSS and used in web browsers. 

It offers several advantages over traditional CSS, such as:

- **Variables:** SCSS allows you to define variables to store and reuse values in your code. This can make your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Nesting:** SCSS allows you to nest selectors inside one another, which can make your code more efficient and easier to read. You can target nested elements without having to repeat selectors.
- **Mixins:** SCSS allows you to define reusable blocks of code called mixins. Mixins can be easily shared across your project, which can save you time and effort.
- **Math functions and color manipulation:** SCSS includes several functions that allow you to perform math calculations and manipulate colors. This can make your code more dynamic and flexible.
